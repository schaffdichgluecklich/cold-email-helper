# Cold Email Helper

A small, ready to use, email toolset that helps you to send "cold" emails with your normal email account and get some basic tracking.

In order to get up and running you need to setup AWS Cognito, a server with a reverse proxy and this go-app and an email account that supports SMTP such as Gmail.
